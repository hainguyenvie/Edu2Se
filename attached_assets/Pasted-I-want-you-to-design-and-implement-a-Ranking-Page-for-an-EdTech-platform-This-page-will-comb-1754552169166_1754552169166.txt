I want you to design and implement a **"Ranking Page"** for an EdTech platform.

This page will combine:

1. **Student Leaderboard** – Highlight top learners (Study With Me, activity, achievements)
2. **Tutor Leaderboard** – Highlight most trusted tutors (ratings, hours, engagement)
3. **KOL/KOC-style profiles** – For both students and tutors, with blog/social links

---

### 🧩 Functional Requirements

#### 🥇 Section 1: Student Ranking Table
- Display top learners by points, study time, or badges earned
- For each student entry, show:
  - Avatar
  - Name
  - Level or title (e.g. “Top Learner”, “Study Marathoner”)
  - Points / badges
  - Link to their public profile (mini blog or study diary)
  - Optional: School name or nickname
  - Rank position (#1, #2...)

#### 🧑‍🏫 Section 2: Tutor Ranking Table
- Display top tutors by:
  - Star rating
  - Total teaching hours
  - Number of completed sessions
- For each tutor, show:
  - Avatar
  - Name
  - Tags: subject(s), vibe, location
  - Rating (1–5 stars)
  - Short intro (max 100 chars)
  - Button/link to tutor’s public profile

#### 🌟 Section 3: Public Profile (for KOL/KOC/Influencer style)
- Each student and tutor can have a public profile page with:
  - Cover banner + avatar
  - Bio and fun facts
  - Blog section (study tips, teaching stories, reflections)
  - Embedded short videos (if available)
  - Social media links (Facebook, TikTok, Instagram, Zalo, etc.)
  - Button to follow or connect

---

### 🖥️ UI Requirements

- Responsive layout
- Tabs or toggle to switch between Student and Tutor ranking
- Modern Gen-Z friendly design (like TikTok + Notion + LinkedIn blend)
- Leaderboard entries with hover effect
- Highlight top 3 users with special icons (🥇🥈🥉)
- Use placeholder images, mock data, and font/icons (e.g. FontAwesome)

---

### 🔧 Technical Suggestions

- Use **HTML + CSS + JavaScript** (or **React + Tailwind CSS** for cleaner structure)
- Keep data in mock JSON or JS array
- Build at least:
  - `RankingPage` component
  - `UserCard` component (used in both tables)
  - `ProfilePage` for individual user (linked from leaderboard)

---

### 📁 Suggested file structure

- `/index.html` or `App.jsx`
- `/components/RankingTabs.jsx`
- `/components/UserCard.jsx`
- `/pages/ProfilePage.jsx`
- `/data/users.js`
- `/style.css` or use Tailwind

---

### 🏁 Goal

- Deliver a **fully functional Ranking Page** that includes:
  - Student and tutor leaderboards
  - Public profile pages (KOL-style)
  - Blog/social/media embedding

- Focus on UX and design scalability for a social-learning platform
