I want you to implement the full **interaction flow** that happens when a user clicks the "Join" button in the “Study With Me” feature.

This is part of a learning platform where users can join public virtual study rooms created by others.

Based on the wireframes, here’s what I need:

---

### 🧩 Functional Flow:

1. **Initial State:**
   - A list of study rooms is displayed (already implemented).
   - Each room has a "Join" (`Tham gia`) button.

2. **When user clicks “Join” on a room:**
   - Step 1: Show a **Login popup** with:
     - Email and password fields
     - Google Sign-In option
     - A login button (blue)

   - Step 2 (after login): Show a **QR Code payment popup**:
     - Displays a VN PAY QR code image
     - Shows price (e.g. "20k VND")
     - Button/text to confirm successful payment (simulate)

   - Step 3 (after payment): Redirect user to the **Room View UI**:
     - Display creator’s avatar, name, rating, and study vibe icons
     - A video section (placeholder or embedded YouTube/HTML5 video)
     - List of participants on the right (avatars)
     - “Share” button (can simulate)

---

### 🔧 Technical Requirements:

- Use **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** (React is okay if necessary)
- Use **modals** or popup components for login and QR payment
- Simulate authentication and payment (no backend needed)
- Use hardcoded user credentials and QR code image
- The room view can be a separate HTML section or routed page
- Maintain simple, responsive layout

---

### 🎨 UI Design:

- Use modern, clean UI with hover/transition effects
- Use Vietnamese UI labels: “Tham gia”, “Đăng nhập”, “Quét QR để tham gia”, etc.
- Use mock avatars and placeholder video

---

### 📁 Suggested structure:

- `index.html` or `App.jsx`: main page with room list
- `loginModal.js`, `paymentModal.js`, `roomView.js`: modal/components
- `style.css` or `Tailwind CSS` for styling

---

### 🏁 Goal:

- Simulate a **full Join Room flow** with three steps:
   1. Login Modal
   2. Payment Modal (QR Code)
   3. Room View Interface (with video + participants)
- No backend, just clean frontend UX for demo/prototype purposes
- Structure code for easy integration into a larger platform
